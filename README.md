# Resu-Maker A resume creation tool
**Note**: This was my first ever React project, I didn't focus on styling ðŸ˜¬ which is probably pretty obvious. Nonetheless, this project was an incredible learning experience and taught me all I wanted to learn to create my portfolio website.
## Features:
- **Add Sections**: Add information to sections you want on your resume (volunteer, work, skills, projects, etc)
- **100% on device**: Don't be afraid to store personal information in this tool as it all runs on device through a local database.
- **Easily swap out sections of your resume for others**: Want to use a different description which better fits the job you're applying for? It's easily done in a few clicks.
